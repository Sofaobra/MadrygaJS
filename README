This is a JavaScript implementation of the little-used Madryga encryption 
algorithm in ECB mode.  It includes 64-bit integer support.  jQuery is used in 
the example code, but is not required for the encryption code itself.

This was done as a learning exercise and is not intended for production use.

NOTE: I didn't write the base64 encoding functions. Those were taken from
http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-base64.html

SAMPLE PAGE USAGE

The program has two modes of operation: encryption and decryption.  To encrypt a piece of text, enter the text into the Plaintext text area, provide a key in the key input, and press the Encrypt button.  The ciphertext will be displayed in a text box below the key, encoded in Base64.  Because web browsers only support text display, the binary output of the algorithm is displayed in Base64 encoding.

After encrypting a piece of plaintext, switch to decryption mode by clicking on the Decryption radio button at the top of the page.  The Base64-encoded ciphertext will be placed in the Ciphertext box now on the top of the page.  You may also enter any other Madryga-encrypted text into the Ciphertext box to decrypt, but it MUST be Base64-encoded.  Once the ciphertext and key have been entered, click the Decrypt button on the bottom of the page.  The original plaintext should be displayed in a text area at the bottom of the page.
